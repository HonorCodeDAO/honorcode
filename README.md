# Honor Code

HONOR implements a *semi-transferable token*, used to manage recognition in a DAO or software project. 

Each unit of HONOR is *vouched* to an *artifact*, representing an entire Org, sub-module, or contribution. 
The "price" of a Vouch claim to an artifact depends on how much HONOR is already vouched, decreasing
as a square root. In return, vouching earns a piece of any money rewards directed at this node. 
As a result, vouching serves as a prediction market for contribution value. 

Additionally, the builder of an artifact receives some Vouch claim as a function of HONOR 
vouched over time, also tapered as a square root or sublinear function of HONOR-hours. 
This step allows for a measure of impact as time goes on, when the value of a contribution becomes more clear.
